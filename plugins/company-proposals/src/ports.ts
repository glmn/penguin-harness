/**
 * The ports the use cases depend on. The service (service.ts), the graph refresher

 * (forge.ts) — are replaceable. No SQL and no `gh` above this line.
 *
 * A write of ProposalStore is one transaction. It takes a `plan`: a synchronous function the
 * adapter calls inside that transaction with the proposal as it stands there, which applies the
 * default rules (guards.ts) and answers what to write — or throws a ProposalError, and nothing is
 * written. No other port is called inside: validation, files, the forge and desk deliveries
